# Job Scraping Logic Summary

## Overview
The bot uses a **base scraper architecture** with specialized scrapers for each job category, built on top of the `python-jobspy` library.

## Core Components

### 1. Base Scraper (`ScraperBase`)
- **Abstract base class** that handles common scraping logic
- **Async execution** with retry mechanisms and anti-detection strategies
- **Environment-aware** site selection (Docker vs Local)
- **Error handling** with fallback strategies

### 2. Job Categories
**49 categories** are now managed via `categories.yml` configuration:
- **Communication**: `"communication OR marketing OR relations publiques OR contenu"`
- **Design**: `"design OR UX OR UI OR graphisme OR créatif OR designer graphique"`
- **Restauration**: `"restauration OR cuisinier OR chef OR serveur OR barman OR sommelier OR commis"`
- **Technology**: `"développeur OR ingénieur logiciel OR tech OR informatique OR data"`
- **Healthcare**: `"santé OR hôpital OR hospitalier"`
- **And 44 more categories** covering all job sectors from agriculture to finance

### 3. Environment Detection
- **Local mode**: Uses both Indeed + LinkedIn with automatic fallback
- **Docker mode**: Uses both Indeed + LinkedIn with automatic fallback
- **Auto-detection** via `/.dockerenv`, `/proc/1/cgroup`, or env variables

## Scraping Process

### 1. Site Strategy
```python
# Environment-based site selection
Local: ["indeed", "linkedin"]    # All sites with fallback
Docker: ["indeed", "linkedin"]   # Indeed + LinkedIn with automatic fallback
```

### 2. Anti-Detection Features
- **Random delays**: 2-8 seconds between requests
- **Extended delays for Indeed**: 5-15 seconds after failures
- **Result limits**: Max 10 results for Indeed to avoid detection
- **User-agent rotation**: Handled by jobspy library

### 3. Retry Logic
- **Max 3 attempts** per scraping session
- **Exponential backoff**: Increasing delays between retries
- **Automatic fallback**: If Indeed fails → try LinkedIn only
- **Error categorization**: 403 blocks, timeouts, connection issues

### 4. Data Processing
- **Pandas DataFrame** → **Pydantic Job models**
- **Data cleaning**: Removes NaN values, formats dates
- **Validation**: Field validation and sanitization
- **Persistence**: Saves to PostgreSQL database with automatic duplicate detection

## Job Model
```python
class Job(BaseModel):
    # Required fields
    title: str
    company: str
    location: str
    date_posted: str
    job_url: str
    site: str
    
    # Optional fields
    salary_source: Optional[str]
    description: Optional[str]
    is_remote: bool = False
    job_type: Optional[str]
    company_industry: Optional[str]
    experience_range: Optional[str]
```

## Error Handling
- **403 Blocks**: Automatic LinkedIn-only fallback
- **Timeouts**: Increased delays and retry
- **Connection issues**: Network problem detection
- **Empty results**: Handles empty results gracefully without database writes

The system prioritizes **stability over quantity**, using conservative request patterns and graceful degradation when sites block access.
